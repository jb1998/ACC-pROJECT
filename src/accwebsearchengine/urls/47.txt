Spotted : On Wednesday March 28th, 2018 at about 830pm the guy in this video entered Subway in Windsor My daughter was working alone. He asked if she could charge his cell phone, he had been recently kicked out of his parents house. He was texting with a girl he said. My daughter was nice enough to charge his phone for him. While she did, he sat in the dining area. She thought nothing of it. At some point, as seen in the video, he got up from the booth in which he was sitting and entered the kitchen without permission and grabbed his phone. After grabbing his phone, he quickly checked it, walked few feet toward the door, and then returns to kitchen door. As you can see in the video, he had his penis out of his pants and he ejaculates on the floor while saying some dirty things to my daughter. She screamed, he turned, left in a hurry. She called me and I went there immediately, I live two blocks away. Upon arriving I instructed her to call 911. Windsor Police came in about 10 minutes and the responding officers were very courteous and were there to help. I appreciate them coming. After a brief interview they left to search neighborhood for the guy. This is the scary part. After they left, my daughter was making sub for customer who came in. The phone kept ringing over and over. She finished making sub for customer then answered the phone. Her eyes lit up with fear, I know her well. She dropped the phone in shock saying, "its him. He is asking me if I liked what I saw and next time it will be better". I grabbed the phone and nobody was there. I hung up. He called back 30 seconds later. I answered and he started talking the same type stuff. Soon as he heard my voice, the coward hung up. We called 911 again and the Police returned very rapidly. We told them what happened and they were surprised he called. That extra step really says something about the guy. He is a predator and very dangerous in my opinion. I asked the Police if they could trace or get the data from that call. It seemed like their hands were tied at their level and needed more to go that far. This shocked me to say the least. In no way do I blame those officers or think it s their fault not going after the call data. On the contrary. I understand their hands may be tied. I appreciate them coming to help, I really do. I am frustrated to say the least. I turn to you fellow citizens. PLEASE help us catch this POS and get him off our streets. If you have a mother, sister, daughter, or any female you love, PLEASE, look at this video and see if you can recognize this guy. If you do, contact the WPD and let them know who it is. Thank you very much everyone. Stay safe 36 386 See All See More
