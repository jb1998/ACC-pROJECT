Overview The Ontario government, in consultation with the Chief Medical Officer of Health, has released A Plan to Safely Reopen Ontario and Manage COVID-19covid 19 for the Long-Term. This plan outlines our cautious and gradual approach to lifting remaining public health and workplace safety measures by March 2022. It will be guided by the ongoing assessment of key public health and health care indicators and supported by local or regional tailored responses to COVID-19covid 19. Over the next six months, we plan to slowly and incrementally lift any remaining public health and workplace safety measures, including: removing the provincial requirement for proof of vaccination wearing face coverings in indoor public settings To ensure that public health and workplace safety measures are lifted safely, this phased approach will be guided by the ongoing assessment and monitoring of key public health and health care indicators, such as: the identification of any new COVID-19covid 19 variants increases in hospitalizations ICU occupancy and rapid increases in transmission In the absence of concerning trends, public health and workplace safety measures will be lifted based on the proposed following milestones (PDF).

Paused: November 15, 2021 We are pausing the lifting of capacity limits in remaining higher-risk settings out of an abundance of caution as the province monitors public health trends. These higher-risk settings include: food or drink establishments with dance facilities such as night clubs and wedding receptions in meeting/event spaces where there is dancing strip clubs sex clubs and bathhouses The government and the Chief Medical Officer of Health will continue to monitor the data for the next 28 days to determine when it is safe to lift capacity limits in these settings. January 17, 2022 In the absence of concerning trends in public health and health care indicators following the winter holiday months and after students return to in-class learning, the province intends to begin gradually lifting capacity limits in settings where proof of vaccination is not required. The Chief Medical Officer of Health will also lift CMOH directives as appropriate. Proof of vaccination requirements may also begin to be gradually lifted at this time, including for: restaurants, bars and other food and drink establishments facilities used for sports and recreational facilities casinos, bingo halls and other gaming establishments February 7, 2022 The government intends to lift proof of vaccination requirements in high-risk settings, including: night clubs strip clubs bathhouses and sex clubs March 28, 2022 At this time, it is intended that remaining public health and workplace safety measures will be lifted, including wearing face coverings in indoor public settings. Recommendations may be released for specific settings, if appropriate. In addition, it is intended that the provincial requirement for proof of vaccination will be lifted for all remaining settings, including: meeting and event spaces sporting events concerts theatres and cinemas racing venues commercial and film productions with studio audiences To manage COVID-19covid 19 over the long-term, local and regional responses by public health units will be deployed based on local context and conditions. Public health measures that may be applied locally could include: reintroducing capacity limits and/or physical distancing reducing gathering limits adding settings where proof of vaccination is required Public health measures may be implemented provincially in exceptional circumstances, such as when the province’s health system capacity is at risk of becoming overwhelmed or if a vaccine resistant COVID-19covid 19 variant is identified in the province.
