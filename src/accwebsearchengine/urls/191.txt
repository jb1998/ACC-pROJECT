Our mission is to ensure that every student in the South West Region attends school well nourished and ready to learn. In doing so, VON works in partnership with 10 public health units, 12 school boards and several community partners across the region to deliver funding and support to over 480 school breakfasts and snack programs. In total, VON flows just under four million dollars in annual funding to support school nutrition programs across the region.
