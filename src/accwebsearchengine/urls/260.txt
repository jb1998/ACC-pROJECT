On this page Skip this page navigation Introduction The Smoke-Free Ontario Act, 2017 (SFOA, 2017) prohibits the use of electronic cigarettes in enclosed workplaces and enclosed public places, such as retail stores (also known as the “places of use” ban). The SFOA, 2017 defines “use” to include the holding of an activated electronic cigarette (i.e., turning it “on”), as well as inhaling and exhaling vapour from the electronic cigarette. The SFOA, 2017 also restricts the display and promotion of vapour products. The Ontario Ministry of Health (the “ministry”) recognizes that some retailers’ main business activity is selling vapour products, and that the display and promotion restrictions and places of use ban may place a burden on these businesses that previously displayed and promoted vapour products, and allowed customers to test and sample vapour products in store prior to purchase. In recognition of this, the SFOA, 2017 has certain exemptions that allow specialty vape stores to display, promote and test/sample vapour products. To access this exemption, Ontario Regulation 268/18 under the SFOA, 2017 (the “regulation”) specifies that a retail establishment must be registered as a specialty vape store with the local board of health for the public health unit in which the business is located. Registration is location-specific. To be registered as a specialty vape store for a specific location, a retail establishment must meet certain criteria as outlined below. Sales and inventory At least 85% of the establishment’s total sales from the previous twelve months is from vapour products, or If the establishment has been in operation for less than one year: At least 85% of the establishment’s total inventory purchases for the time it has been in existence consists of vapour products; or At least 85% of the total sales for the time it has been in existence consists of vapour products; The remaining sales or inventory are from other items reasonably associated with a vapour product or branded with the name of the specialty vape store or a brand of vapour product. Additional criteria Minors (younger than age 19) shall not be permitted to enter the establishment, other than the store owner, employees, or a support person accompanying a person with a disability who is at least 19 years old. The establishment must be a building or located inside a building. Customers can only enter the establishment from the outdoors or from the areas of an enclosed shopping mall that are: Open to the public; Common to most of the retail establishments or other businesses within the mall; and Not part of the retail establishment or other business within the mall. The establishment must not be a thoroughfare. Rules for display and promotion Under the regulation, registered specialty vape stores can display and promote vapour products, but only within the retail establishment. Displays and promotions in front of the retail establishment are not permitted. Effective July 1, 2020, a specialty vape store must ensure that all indoor displays and promotion of vapour products are not visible from outside the store at any time of day. Rules for in-store testing and sampling Under the regulation, activating an electronic cigarette (i.e., turning it “on”) in a registered specialty vape store is permitted, if the following conditions are met: Activation is for the purpose of testing the electronic cigarette or demonstrating to customers how the device can be activated. No vapour is inhaled or exhaled from the activated electronic cigarette. The electronic cigarette does not contain tobacco. Under the regulation, using an electronic cigarette (including inhaling and exhaling vapour from an electronic cigarette) in a registered specialty vape store is permitted, if the following conditions are met: Use is for the purpose of sampling a vapour product. No more than two persons may sample a vapour product at the same time. Specialty vape stores must provide fresh, one-time use disposable mouthpieces for sampling, unless the electronic cigarette is the personal possession of the person holding it. The electronic cigarette must not contain cannabis, tobacco, (e.g., Heat-Not-Burn tobacco products), or a controlled substance. Responsibilities of retailers who are registered specialty vape stores A retailer who operates a specialty vape store must comply with other applicable provisions in the SFOA, 2017 and the regulation. Display and promotion of tobacco products Retailers that sell electronic cigarettes containing tobacco or tobacco for use in electronic cigarettes (e.g. heat sticks or capsules used in Heat-Not-Burn devices) must comply with the prohibition on displaying and promoting tobacco products, unless the business registers as a tobacconist (see Guidelines for Registration as a Tobacconist). An electronic cigarette or component of an electronic cigarette that is manufactured or sold for use with tobacco products (e.g., Heat-Not-Burn devices), but packaged without a tobacco component, are considered to be vapour products, not tobacco product accessories for the purposes of display and promotion rules. As a result, these products are subject to rules for the display and promotion of vapour products, and not the display and promotion rules for tobacco product accessories. Age-based sales restrictions Before selling tobacco or vapour products to anyone who appears to be less than 25 years old, a retailer must request identification and be satisfied that the person is at least 19 years old. Acceptable identification must include a photograph of the person, the person’s date of birth, and reasonably appear to have been issued by a government or the Liquor Control Board of Ontario. Some examples are: Ontario driver’s license; Canadian passport; Canadian citizenship; Canadian Armed Forces identification card; Ontario photo card; or Liquor Control Board of Ontario photo card Required signs All retailers must post ‘No Smoking’ and ‘No Vaping’ signs, or a dual ‘No Smoking and No Vaping’ sign at all entrances, exits, and washrooms, in appropriate locations and sufficient numbers, to ensure that everyone knows that smoking and vaping is prohibited inside the establishment. Vapour Product Retailers All stores selling vapour products at retail must post, in clear view of the seller and customer at the point of sale: A Vapour Product Age Restriction sign. A Vapour Product Identification sign. Tobacco Retailers All stores selling tobacco products at retail must post, in clear view of the seller and customer at the point of sale: A Tobacco Product Age Restriction sign.
