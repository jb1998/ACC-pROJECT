Post Pandemic - How Covid-19 is Reshaping Canada "pandemic" "post pandemic" "postmedia" "national post" The COVID-19 pandemic has changed everything, from how we work, to how we shop, from what and how we eat to how we interact socially and what we care about politically. The virus is indiscriminate in who it infects, but its effects have hardly been equitable — disadvantaged populations have seen higher rates of infection and more deaths. It has revealed fissures in the foundations of modern society, including how global supply chains have left us vulnerable, how easily healthcare systems — and those who operate it — can be overwhelmed, the gaps in how we care for the elderly and other marginalized populations and how fragile our own mental health can be. After a year of living with COVID-19, Postmedia is taking an in-depth look at the significant social, institutional and economic issues the pandemic has brought to light in Canada — and more importantly, how we can finally begin to solve them.

In Ontario and Quebec, which have struggled to contain the virus and have recorded the majority of COVID-19 fatalities in the country, deaths were split relatively evenly between the spring and winter waves. For western and prairie provinces, the period since Nov. 1 has been the pandemic’s deadliest. Over 80 per cent of deaths in provinces from Manitoba to B.C. have occurred since Nov. 1. In the Territories, which suffered no deaths – and very few cases – during the spring and summer, there were only a handful of deaths during the winter wave. The majority of coronavirus-related deaths in New Brunswick have also occurred since the beginning of November – in contrast to Nova Scotia where virtually all deaths were reported in the spring. As of Feb. 1 of this year, there have been no deaths reported from COVID-19 in either Prince Edward Island or the Northwest Territories. Tracking the vaccine rollout Provincial numbers can only tell so much. XXX. Reported vaccinations by province or territory Vaccines from AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson are currently under review by Health Canada. AstraZeneca’s vaccine has been approved in other countries and is easier to store than both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. It is expected that the AstraZeneca vaccine will be approved early this year. Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine only requires a single shot, which would simplify vaccination efforts, but it is further back in the approval process. The federal government initially signed agreements with seven companies, including the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines already in use and the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines under review, to secure access to up to 414 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine candidates. TRACKING THE CORONAVIRUS IN CANADA The federal government, whose role is to authorize and purchase vaccines then deliver them to the provinces, plans to make vaccines available to every Canadian this year. It has secured delivery of 80 million vaccines this year. For now, priority will go to high-risk populations. Getting the vaccines into the arms of as many people as possible, as quickly as possible, presents tremendous logistical challenges, however, and the start of the vaccine rollout has gone more slowly than many had hoped. Despite receiving the first round of vaccines in mid-December, vaccination rates in Canada lag behind many countries, including the U.S. TRACKING THE CORONAVIRUS IN CANADA TRACKING THE CORONAVIRUS IN CANADA Cases Deaths Vaccinations Contact Us Site Map Copyright Privacy © 2021 The National Post, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.

The surge in hiring in June resulted in the second-lowest unemployment rate since the start of the pandemic. Why it matters: The unemployment rate can be unreliable, but it’s still one of the first gauges that economists check. Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem has indicated that he will want to see the jobless rate back at pre-pandemic levels of around 5.5 per cent before he considers raising interest rates. June 2021: There were about 18.8 million Canadians in paid employment, an increase of 231,000 from the previous month. There still were about 300,000 fewer positions than at the start of the pandemic. Why it matters: Employment plunged by about three million positions in the immediate aftermath of the initial lockdowns, triggering an epic economic collapse. The recovery won’t be complete until all of those jobs are restored. June 2021: There were about 477,000 people who had been for at least 27 weeks, a drop of 0.3 per cent from May. The number of long-term unemployed is almost three times as large as it was at the start of the pandemic. Why it matters: The longer people spend on the sidelines of the labour market, the harder it becomes for them to find jobs that maximize their potential because their skills atrophy. The strength of Canada’s post-pandemic economy will be determined by how quickly this number shrinks. March 2021: There were 893,090 active businesses in Canada, about 1.4 per cent fewer than at the start of the pandemic, but 102,000 more than when the crisis was its most acute in May 2020. Why it matters: Canada struggled after the Great Recession because there were too few companies left to take full advantage of the global recovery. A goal of policy-makers this time is to keep more companies intact. An encouraging sign is the surge in entrepreneurship. “New entrants” averaged 17,461 between October and March, compared with a monthly average of 15,111 in 2019. Q1 2020: Household disposable income increased 2.3 per cent from the end of 2019, reversing the two consecutive quarterly declines that followed the second-quarter surge in 2020, which is when the federal government started issuing COVID-19 benefits. Why it matters: The federal government compensated for effectively closing entire industries with generous emergency benefits. Those payments now represent a potential source of stimulus as the economy reopens. Consumers are sitting on a cash pile that is nine-per-cent bigger than a year earlier. May 2021: Canada shipped goods worth about $59.5 billion abroad, a small decrease from the previous month, but still about 3.6 per cent more than at the start of the pandemic. Surging commodity prices are driving the recovery. Services exports continue to suffer from a lack of tourism; they were about 15 per cent lower than February 2020. Why it matters: Canada produces more than its relatively small population can consume, so the country relies on exports to maximize wealth creation. Overall, the export recovery is a positive, mostly because of stronger prices for many of the commodities that Canada produces. June 2021: Total hours worked dropped 0.2 per cent from May, as stricter social distancing measures in most provinces limited traffic at restaurants, stores and other high-touch businesses. Hours had almost returned to pre-pandemic levels. They are now about four per cent lower. Why it matters: Hours worked is one of the better guides of economic health, so much so that Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland said that she would be watching it to help determine how much stimulus will be needed in the future. The hole left by the recession had been nearly filled until the third wave caused a setback. April 2021: Residential mortgage credit increased 7.7 per cent from a year earlier, the fastest since September 2010. Meanwhile, non-mortgage loans, a proxy for business credit, dropped 2.1 per cent from a year earlier, the second consecutive monthly decline and the biggest decrease since June 2010. Why it matters: The housing market is one of the catalysts of the recovery, but many fear mania is now setting in, as house prices in some markets have detached from fundamentals. Meanwhile, few will believe the economy is truly solid until business lending returns to pre-pandemic levels. April 2021: Retail sales plunged six per cent from March to $49.3 billion, the lowest in two months but still three per cent higher than at the start of the pandemic. Retail sales collapsed in April 2020, and then rallied as generous emergency benefits and a reduced offering of services stoked demand for goods. Why it matters: Domestic consumption is the primary engine of Canada’s economy, and retail sales are the best way to monitor that contribution. Spending patterns changed, but overall demand held up remarkably well during the crisis.
