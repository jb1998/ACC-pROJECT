Meals on Wheels (MOW) helps those who are unable to shop for their own food or to cook, maintain their independence at home by delivering nutritious, delicious and affordable meals throughout Windsor. MOW also provides clients with a caring connection to the community. Our clients include seniors, people recovering from illness or surgery, and people with disabilities. We assist those who need short term (caregiver relief, recuperation, seasonal) or long term assistance. No long term contract necessary. We deliver hot, nutritious meals which accommodate a variety of diet types and texture modifications. Our meals are delivered by our friendly volunteers, Monday to Friday between 10:45 am and 1 pm. Frozen meals are available for clients who prefer flexibility, such as just heating a meal for weekends or holidays. Note: Due to COVID 19, only frozen meals are available and delivered weekly on Tuesdays by our volunteers. Hot meals will resume at a later time. Working in partnership with the Unemployed Help Centre, meals are prepared in a brand new state of the art kitchen, featuring fresh, locally grown produce and fruits. Meals include: soup, entrée, (including a protein, vegetable and starch), bread and dessert. Vegetarian, chopped, minced and pureed meals are accommodated. There is a fee of $6.75 per meal. Veterans can receive subsidization through Veteran’s Affairs. New! For those wanting a lighter meal option, Soup meal entrees are now available! A soup meal includes a soup, roll and dessert for $3.75. Note: Due to COVID 19, only frozen Soup meals are available and delivered weekly on Tuesdays by our volunteers. Hot Soup meals will resume at a later time. Please call 519-254-4866 ext. 1 to order. Click here to view and print a VON Meals on Wheels brochure. Client Testimonial: "The most important benefit I receive from the Meals on Wheels Program is that it has allowed me to remain living independently in my own home. I also look forward to my visits from the volunteers. They always have a way of brightening my day." - Mary (Meals on Wheels Client) Programs Donate Get Involved Events Home Chatham-Kent Sarnia-Lambton Windsor-Essex Pelee Island About VON News Contact Us © Erie St. Clair VON 2021 Site by CCI Studios
