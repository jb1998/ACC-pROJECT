Today, most women breastfeed their babies. Breastfeeding is important and gives your baby just the right amount of protein, carbohydrates, fat, vitamins, and minerals. Breastfeeding provides antibodies and other immune factors. These help protect against infections and disease. On this page For a young infant (birth to 6 months) For an older infant (6 to 12 months) For a young child (12 to 24 months) Safe feeding tips Menus for older infants and young children What you can offer a 7-month old infant What you can offer an 11-month old infant What you can offer a 17-month old child What you can offer a 17-month old vegetarian child For a young infant (birth to 6 months) Breastfeeding is the only food or drink your baby will need for the first 6 months. Babies who are breastfed should get a vitamin D supplement of 10 micrograms (µg) or 400 international units (IU) each day. This will prevent vitamin D deficiency. If your baby is not breastfed, or is only partially breastfed, commercial infant formulas are an alternative to breast milk. Non-breastfed infants do not require a vitamin D supplement because the commercial infant formula contains vitamin D. For an older infant (6 to 12 months) Continue to breastfeed for up to two years or more, as long as both you and your child want to. Continue to give your breastfed infant a vitamin D supplement of 10 µg (400 IU). At 6 months, breastfeeding is still your baby’s main food source, but it is time to begin adding solid foods. Formula-fed infants should also be introduced to solid foods at this time. Start with foods that contain iron and offer them a few times each day. Iron supports your baby’s growth and development. Iron-rich foods include meats such as beef, lamb, game, poultry, and fish. Meat alternatives include eggs, tofu, and legumes such as beans and lentils. Iron-fortified infant cereal is also a common first food. Gradually increase the number of times a day that you offer solid foods. Offer your baby a range of nutritious foods from your family meals. Let them discover different textures and experiment with feeding themselves. Give your baby foods they can eat using their hands. Offer pieces of soft-cooked vegetables, soft fruit such as banana, grated cheese, bread crusts and toast. If you are making the transition to cow milk as your child’s main milk source, wait until your baby is between 9 and 12 months old. Start with homogenized cow milk (3.25% M.F.). Do not offer skim or partly skimmed milk (1% or 2% M.F.) before 2 years of age. If you are going to make fortified soy beverage your child’s main milk source, wait until they are 2 years of age. Rice or nut beverages should not be used as your child’s main milk source. Pay attention to your baby’s hunger cues. Trust your child to decide how much they are going to eat at any meal. Did you know... Using an open cup will encourage your baby to develop their drinking skills. Give your baby an open cup when offering fluids other than breast milk. At first, your baby will need help with the cup. For a young child (12 to 24 months) By 12 months, your child needs a variety of foods from the food groups. Learn more about Canada's Food Guide. Establish a schedule of regular meals and snacks for your child. Breastfeed as long as you and your child want to continue. Continue to give your breastfed child a vitamin D supplement of 10 µg (400 IU). This provides a daily source of vitamin D. If you are no longer breastfeeding, offer 500 milliliters (mL) of homogenized milk (3.25% M.F.) each day. Your child may like to drink a lot of milk. You should limit them to 750 mL each day to not affect their intake of other foods. Higher-fat, nutritious foods are an important source of energy for your child. Examples include breast milk, homogenized cow milk (3.25% M.F.), cheese, avocado, nut butters, and some fish such as salmon or trout. Limit fruit juice and do not offer sweetened beverages. If your child seems thirsty, offer water. Eat together as a family as often as you can. Be a role model; try new and nutritious foods yourself. Safe feeding tips Always supervise your child when eating. Make sure your child is sitting upright and is not distracted. Do not let your child eat while walking or running, or while sitting in a moving vehicle. Introduce common food allergens one at a time. A food allergen can cause an allergic reaction in some children (like itchy skin, upset stomach or wheezing).Wait two days before introducing a new food. That way, if your baby develops a reaction, you'll have a better idea of what food might have caused it. Do not offer solid foods that are hard, small and round, or smooth and sticky. These foods can cause choking. Do not offer herbal teas, sports drinks or other drinks with caffeine or artificial sweeteners. Cook all meat, eggs, poultry, and fish well. Do not use products with raw eggs to avoid salmonella poisoning. Do not offer unpasteurized juices, milk or milk products. To prevent infant botulism, do not offer honey to a baby younger than 12 months. For more information speak to your healthcare provider. You can also get practical infant feeding resources from your regional public health unit or community health centre. Menus for older infants and young children These menus are only a guide.
