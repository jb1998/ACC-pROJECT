Public Health and Public Order Outcomes Associated with Supervised Drug Consumption Facilities: a Systematic Review | SpringerLink Skip to main content Advertisement Search Log in Search SpringerLink Search Associated Content Part of a collection: Topical Collection on The Science of Prevention The Science of Prevention (JD Stekler and J Baeten, Section Editors) Published: 05 September 2017 Public Health and Public Order Outcomes Associated with Supervised Drug Consumption Facilities: a Systematic Review Mary Clare Kennedy1,2, Mohammad Karamouzian1,3 & Thomas Kerr 1,4 Current HIV/AIDS Reports volume 14, pages 161–183 (2017)Cite this article 6275 Accesses 79 Citations 209 Altmetric Metrics details Abstract Purpose of Review Supervised drug consumption facilities (SCFs) have increasingly been implemented in response to public health and public order concerns associated with illicit drug use. We systematically reviewed the literature investigating the health and community impacts of SCFs. Recent Findings Consistent evidence demonstrates that SCFs mitigate overdose-related harms and unsafe drug use behaviours, as well as facilitate uptake of addiction treatment and other health services among people who use drugs (PWUD). Further, SCFs have been associated with improvements in public order without increasing drug-related crime. SCFs have also been shown to be cost-effective. Summary This systematic review suggests that SCFs are effectively meeting their primary public health and order objectives and therefore supports their role within a continuum of services for PWUD. Additional studies are needed to better understand the potential long-term health impacts of SCFs and how innovations in SCF programming may help to optimize the effectiveness of this intervention.
