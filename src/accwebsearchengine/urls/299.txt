Recipients of solid-organ transplant and taking immunosuppressive therapy Recipients of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T-cell therapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplant (within 2 years of transplantation or taking immunosuppression therapy). Individuals with moderate to severe primary immunodeficiency (e.g., DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome). Individuals with stage 3 or advanced untreated HIV infection and those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Individuals receiving active treatment with the following categories of immunosuppressive therapies: anti-B cell therapies2 (monoclonal antibodies targeting CD19, CD20 and CD22), high-dose systemic corticosteroids (refer to the CIG for suggested definition of high dose steroids), alkylating agents, antimetabolites, or tumor-necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors and other biologic agents that are significantly immunosuppressive (see Table 1 [19] in the Ministry of Health Third Dose Recommendations Guidance Document for the list of immunosuppressant medications for third doses). Booking Information Your third dose must occur at least two months (8 weeks) after your second dose. In order to optimize the immune response from the vaccine series and minimize delays in the management of their underlying condition, individuals should consult with their health care provider beforehand to determine the exact timing of their vaccination. Those uncertain about their eligibility should contact their health care provider prior to scheduling a vaccination appointment. To schedule a vaccination appointment at the mass vaccination site, please call 226-773-2200, available from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday - Friday, 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday - Sunday. Third doses are being offered to the above groups based on evidence of gradual waning immunity 6 months after receiving their second dose and a higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. If you received an mRNA as your initial two doses, the third dose should be the same vaccine product as the second dose (some exceptions apply). As a precautionary measure, the third dose of an mRNA vaccine should be deferred in individuals who have experienced myocarditis or pericarditis following any preceding dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine until more information is available (NACI, 2021 [20]). To learn more about third dose recommendations, see the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) guidance statement [21] and COVID-19 Vaccine Third Dose Recommendations [19] from the Ontario Ministry of Health.
