Smoke-Free Multi-Unit Dwellings The majority of Ontarians living in apartments, condos, duplexes, or other multi-unit dwellings do not smoke in their homes and prefer smoke-free environments. These residents can still be impacted by the harmful effects of second-hand smoke, as up to 65% of the air in a unit can come from other units in the building. A smoke-free policy across all units means cleaner and fresher indoor air for all residents as well as a reduced risk of fire. To respond to health concerns, Ontario landlords and housing providers are now offering more smoke-free options for residents of multi-unit dwellings. Multi-unit dwellings include but are not limited to: Multi-storey apartment buildings and condominiums Houses partitioned into separate apartments Duplexes and triplexes Row houses Semi-detached houses Smoke-Free Housing Ontario The Smoke Free Housing Ontario website is a great resource if you’re a landlord or property manager, tenant, condominium owner, or housing co-op member. There are a number of tools and resources to help you make your home or property smoke-free.

It is against the law for any person – driver or passenger – to smoke or vape in a vehicle with a child under the age of 16. The person who is charged with smoking or vaping would be subject to a fine up to $155. The law applies to moving and stationary vehicles and to motor vehicles, regardless of whether any window, sunroof, door or other feature is open. Smoking in vehicles can be up to 27 times more concentrated than in a smoker’s home because of the enclosed and smaller space. Even if there is no smoking when children are present, there will still be toxin residue present that can harm everyone (this is often referred to as third-hand smoke).

Let people travelling with you know that the car is smoke-free and offer to stop for cigarette breaks if necessary.
