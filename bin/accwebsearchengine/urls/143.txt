Overview The Provincial Antigen Screening Program (PASP) provides free rapid antigen test kits to high-risk communities, organizations and workplaces. Check your eligibility and apply below. The program is available to all organizations that are allowed to be open under current public health measures, and also require people to be physically present on site. Any organization mandated to test through a provincial vaccine policy like Directive 6 (PDF) is also eligible. Step 1: Review the information on this page Step 2: Check eligibility and apply for the PASP Step 3: Order free test kits from the distributor serving your sector What you need to know before you apply Rapid antigen testing is an additional screening method that can help stop the spread of COVID-19covid 19 in workplaces and other high-risk settings. Organizations can choose to have employees test on-site or have them self-swab at home before coming into the workplace. Rapid antigen tests produce results in about 15 minutes and don’t require shipping to a lab. Rapid antigen testing may be performed at least one time per week, and up to 2-3 times per week. Rapid antigen tests provided through the Provincial Antigen Screening Program are available for use with employees and other identified groups (for example, patients, essential caregivers, post-secondary students), but are not to be used to screen customers/patrons or the general public. Program requirements Organizations taking part in the PASP are required to: agree to the program terms and conditions review the testing guidance (PDF) and training materials notify their local Public Health Unit before your testing program begins order their free test kits from the distribution partner responsible for their sector report de-identified testing data to the province each week properly handle and dispose of used test kits Anyone who is “trained” can perform a test Rapid antigen tests can be performed by health professionals or any individual who is trained (including self-swabbing). Any individual is considered trained when they have consulted the appropriate training materials.

Once testing is introduced, continue to use PPE, wash hands and practice appropriate distancing. Rapid tests should not be used during an outbreak unless they are used in addition to (not as a replacement for) diagnostic testing and under the guidance of the local Public Health Unit. Test people who don’t have symptoms and people who are not fully-vaccinated Test people who have no COVID-19covid 19 symptoms and are not a close contact of someone with COVID-19covid 19. Antigen POCT screening is generally not recommended for individuals who are fully vaccinated as the likelihood of COVID-19covid 19 is low for this group which could result in an increase of false positive results. For many sectors, participation is voluntary and people are not required to disclose their vaccination status in order to screen. All individuals should continue to follow all other public health measures in the workplace.
