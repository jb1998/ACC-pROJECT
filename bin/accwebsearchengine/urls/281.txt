The SFOA, 2017 is enforced by Health Unit Tobacco and Vaping Enforcement officers and protects and regulates smoking in public places. Places of Use In addition to the below spaces where the smoking of tobacco was previously restricted under the former SFOA, this new Act prohibits both smoking of tobacco or cannabis as well as the vaping of any substance in/on: Enclosed (indoor) public places Enclosed work places such as office buildings, factories, vehicles Common areas of multi-unit dwellings such as apartment buildings and condos Playgrounds and sport fields- on and within 20 meters of any playground or municipal sports field.

A Guide for Retailers [3] (also in French [4]) is available to help owners, employers and employees understand the requirements set out in the SFOA, 2017 [5] regarding the sale, supply, display and promotion of tobacco and vapour products. You can also learn more about selling and displaying tobacco and vapour products on Government of Ontario website [6]. Changes made to the SFOA, 2017 also affect Tobacconists and Speciality Vape Store owners. Tobacconist and Speciality Vape Store In addition to restricting places were smoking and vaping is allowed, the Smoke-Free Ontario Act, 2017 [7] (SFOA, 2017) prohibits the display and promotion of tobacco products, branded tobacco product accessories, vapour products, and any other prescribed product or substance at places where they are sold. It also bans the sale of tobacco products, e-cigarettes, and e-juice to anyone under the age of 19. These regulations have already been in place for tobacco products under the previous legislation, but the regulations related to vapour products, e-cigarettes, and other prescribed products and substances are new under the SFOA, 2017.

Thank everyone for respecting your smoke-free home. Smoke-Free Multi-Unit Dwellings The majority of Ontarians living in apartments, condos, duplexes, or other multi-unit dwellings do not smoke in their homes and prefer smoke-free environments. These residents can still be impacted by the harmful effects of second-hand smoke, as up to 65% of the air in a unit can come from other units in the building. A smoke-free policy across all units means cleaner and fresher indoor air for all residents as well as a reduced risk of fire. To respond to health concerns, Ontario landlords and housing providers are now offering more smoke-free options for residents of multi-unit dwellings. Multi-unit dwellings include but are not limited to: Multi-storey apartment buildings and condominiums Houses partitioned into separate apartments Duplexes and triplexes Row houses Semi-detached houses Smoke-Free Housing Ontario The Smoke Free Housing Ontario website [25] is a great resource if you’re a landlord or property manager, tenant, condominium owner, or housing co-op member. There are a number of tools and resources [26] to help you make your home or property smoke-free.

It is against the law for any person – driver or passenger – to smoke or vape in a vehicle with a child under the age of 16. The person who is charged with smoking or vaping would be subject to a fine up to $155. The law applies to moving and stationary vehicles and to motor vehicles, regardless of whether any window, sunroof, door or other feature is open. Smoking in vehicles can be up to 27 times more concentrated than in a smoker’s home because of the enclosed and smaller space. Even if there is no smoking when children are present, there will still be toxin residue present that can harm everyone (this is often referred to as third-hand smoke).

Let people travelling with you know that the car is smoke-free and offer to stop for cigarette breaks if necessary.
