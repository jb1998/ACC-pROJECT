Ontario Public Service Statement of Commitment The OPS endeavours to demonstrate leadership for accessibility in Ontario. Our goal is to ensure accessibility for our employees and the public we serve in our services, products and facilities. Ontario Public Service accessibility plans and policies Ontario has set standards for accessibility under the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2005. The Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation (Ontario Regulation 191/11), under the act, includes accessibility standards for Customer Service, Information and Communications, Employment, Transportation and the Design of Public Spaces.
