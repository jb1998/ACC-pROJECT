There is a variety of local supports available to reduce these barriers and help residents who have appointments attend the vaccination sites. Furthermore, COVID-19 has disproportionately affected certain neighbourhoods and communities across Windsor and Essex County, making some areas “Hot Spots” for COVID-19 rates, deaths, hospitalizations, and transmission. Local efforts are in place to help those living in “Hot Spot” postal code areas of N8X, N8Y, N9A, N9B, N9C, N8H, and N9Y attend their vaccination appointments as safely and easily as possible. Free Transportation for “Hot Spot” Communities Residents living in “Hot Spot” postal code areas of N8X, N8Y, N9A, N9B, N9C, N8H, and N9Y can contact Vets Cab at (519) 256-2621 or Sun Parlor Taxi at (519) 326-9063 to take advantage of the Windsor-Essex Regional Chamber of Commerce program and arrange free transportation to the Devonshire Mall mass vaccination site. Free Childcare for Families and “Hot Spot” Communities The ‘Be Back Soon’ program run by Connections Early Years Family Centre, funded through Pathway to Potential, provides no-cost, unlicensed short-term childcare for qualifying parents with young children by Registered Early Childhood educators. Families who qualify can utilize this service while they attend their vaccination appointment. This program is also providing free unlicensed childcare to families living in “Hot Spot” postal code areas of N8X, N8Y, N9A, N9B, N9C, N8H, and N9Y while they attend their vaccination appointment. Transportation is available. For more information or to book and appointment, contact Connections at 519-252-9696. Free Transportation for Individuals with Mobility Issues or Disabilities The Government of Ontario is investing in a partnership with the Ontario Community Support Association (OCSA) to help provide free transportation to individuals with a physical disability or mobility issue, including seniors with mobility issues, and no access to safe transportation during COVID-19. To be eligible, you must: have a vaccine appointment booked for the date you are requesting transportation, be a person with a disability, including physical, mental, developmental, learning, mobility, vision, or hearing impairment, and have limited or no access to safe and accessible transportation or face barriers to getting to and from a COVID-19 vaccine appointment. Visit the OCSA website to Request a Ride now. Accessible Transportation Services Checker Cab: Residents who require wheelchair accessible taxi services can contact Checker Cab at (519) 254-7777.

Residents must book in advance of their ride to ensure availability. Please call 1-855-728-1433 ext. 1 for more information and to book your rides. Transit Windsor – Vaccine Free Ride Program Transit Windsor is currently offering a Vaccine Free Ride program for all individuals requiring transportation services. This service provides free round-trip service to those being vaccinated at a mass vaccination site – simply let the bus operator know you are traveling to or from your vaccination appointment to receive your free trip.
