Testing is the only way to confirm if someone has COVID-19. The rate of infection (percentage of tests that are positive for COVID-19) shows if the virus is spreading in the community and where the hotspots are. This information helps public health officials make recommendations to reduce further spread. Ontario Health, the provincial government, Public Health Ontario and health system partners are working together to ensure that anyone who needs a test can get a test. This work is in accordance with the testing guidance by the Chief Medical Officer of Health that considers evidence-based recommendations from a Testing Strategy Expert Panel via Public Health Ontario. The guidance covers who to test, what tests to use and where tests should be done. Ontario Health’s role in testing is coordination, specifically specimen collection, transportation / routing, lab analysis and reporting. All of our work is aligned with the Ministry of Health’s most up-to-date evidence-based guidance. Ontario Health helps to secure testing supplies (swabs, reagents, etc.) for the public health system and distributes them to assessment centres, hospitals, long-term care homes, etc., in alignment with Ontario Health’s regional work in planning and supporting COVID-19 testing.

Specimen Collection Specimen collection began with the opening of assessment centres designed specifically for COVID-19 testing. This approach helps manage risk and divert the flow of potential COVID-positive patients from hospital emergency departments, freeing those resources for other urgent patient care. In addition, a partnership between pharmacies and the Ontario government has expanded access to convenient and timely testing according to the testing guidelines for a specific list of asymptomatic individuals. COVID-19 testing locations now include more than 171 assessment centres and up to 213 pharmacies. Plus mobile testing or pop-up facilities are set up in areas where there is need for additional testing or to reach a specific or vulnerable population. Mobile testing sites are developed with the help of local partners and Public Health Units and are operated by various community partners, often in partnership with assessment centres. Transportation / Routing, Laboratory Analysis and Reporting To efficiently analyze the tests, Ontario Health and its partners quickly established a Provincial Diagnostic Network of more than 40 independent, hospital, public health and community laboratories. This network of labs coordinates the processing and analysis of COVID-19 tests, enabling specimens to be efficiently routed to labs that have testing capacity so they can be analyzed as quickly as possible. Specimens are collected and delivered to a lab via a specifically designated network of couriers and Ornge, Ontario’s air ambulance service and medical transport, to ensure timely turnaround times. After the specimen is analyzed, the result is entered into the Ontario Laboratories Information System (OLIS). Data in OLIS is used by the Ministry of Health to track and report the spread of COVID-19, to inform government decisions, and deploy appropriate resources and response. Public Health Units also use OLIS data to look at where testing is needed within their communities and advise on local public health prevention measures and strategies. All positive tests are communicated to the facility where the swab was taken (i.e., assessment centre, pharmacy, etc.) and to the person’s local public health unit. The public health unit then follows up with the individual with instructions on how to self-isolate and interviews them for contact tracing. If the individual provided their health card number at the time of testing, they can access their test result through the COVID-19 Test Result Viewer. A person with a positive result who also uses the COVID-19 mobile app can request a one-time key code to notify other app users of a potential exposure to the virus. Test results may also be available through the patient portals at some hospitals. These portals do not provide a key code for the COVID-19 mobile app, however. The province aims to have 80 per cent of individuals receive their test results within 2 days. Ontario Health is working with health system partners and the Ministry of Health to continue to expand the provincial lab network’s capacity by securing key supplies, technology and lab staff. It is also working to expand its reporting at both the provincial, regional and sub-regional level. Outbreak Management Ontario Health has set up a separate process for congregate settings in outbreak, from the time the specimen is collected, through transportation/routing, to the result being processed and communicated. The goal with this new dedicated process is for test results to be available within 2 days. Types of Tests PCR Lab Tests PCR (also known as polymerase chain reaction) tests show if someone currently has COVID-19. Swabs have to be shipped to one of more than 40 laboratories across Ontario in order to be analyzed. In a lab, technicians can process and analyze about 96 of these tests per machine in 4 to 6 hours. Shown to be highly accurate, the PCR lab test is the gold-standard of COVID-19 testing. Rapid Molecular Tests Like the PCR lab test, a rapid molecular test looks for virus cells and shows if someone has a current COVID-19 infection. This test can be analyzed at the same site the sample is taken, using a portable analyzer box. Each analyzer box can process 3 to 4 tests per hour. Rapid testing in Ontario will initially be used to increase access to testing in parts of the province with longer turnaround times for results, such as in rural and remote communities where transportation of specimens takes longer. They also will be used to support early identification and management of outbreaks. Throughout these initial usages, the rapid molecular test will be carefully evaluated because these are new tests and are less sensitive than lab-based PCR tests. We are evaluating them carefully to ensure they add value. Rapid Antigen Tests The antigen test looks for proteins from the COVID-19 virus. Results are available in about 15 to 20 minutes, at the same site the sample is taken. This test may be useful for repeated screening of asymptomatic people in high-risk settings, such as staff, volunteers, residents or visitors in long-term care homes. Antigen tests are not as accurate at PCR tests, however. Consequently, people who receive a positive result with an antigen test, but who are considered low risk (e.g., no symptoms, no exposure to a confirmed case), may require a confirmation PCR test. Targeted testing with rapid molecular or antigen tests may improve accessibility to testing and help alleviate the burden on labs. However, rapid testing does not replace the gold standard of lab-based PCR testing; these are complementary tools. Find the latest guidance and resources to support the provincial antigen screening program here. Serology Test A serology test looks for antibodies to COVID-19 in the blood. The results may help determine if a person has been infected with COVID-19 in the past. However, the accuracy of serology tests has not been proven. It is not yet known whether having these antibodies means that a person is immune to COVID-19. Given gaps in our understanding of the immune response in COVID-19, serology testing has very limited clinical value for individual patients and is currently available in Ontario to specific populations only.
